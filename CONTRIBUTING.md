# Contributing to Deforum

Firstly, thank you for your interest in contributing to Deforum! Every contribution helps, and we sincerely appreciate the effort. Here are some guidelines that will help you on your path.

## Design Philosophy

The design philosophy of Deforum is based on the PyTorch design philosophy, with a focus on usability, simplicity, and best-in-class language interoperability.

### Principle 1: Usability over Performance

Deforum's primary goal is usability. We strive to maintain flexibility and avoid strict restrictions that may reduce user experience. We strive for users to be able to seamlessly use our toolkit on different platforms and interoperate with different libraries and frameworks.

### Principle 2: Simple Over Easy

Deforum prefers simplicity and explicitness over ease of use. We strive to make our building blocks simple to understand, debug, and use. While we do acknowledge the value of 'easy', our focus is to ensure users have an uncomplicated experience, even when they need to leave the beaten path.

### Principle 3: Python First with Best In Class Language Interoperability

Deforum is deeply integrated with Python, providing users with flexible, familiar, and straightforward usage. Our aim is to be able to integrate with all the robust scientific computing libraries and extensions available in Python while maintaining optimal performance.

## How can you contribute?

There are several areas in which you can contribute:

- **Code**: We are always happy to receive code contributions. If you want to add a feature, first create a new issue. If you find a bug or a mistake, feel free to fix it and submit a pull request.

- **Documentation**: Documentation is as important as the code itself. If you find a bug, mistake, a non-clear part or you think some part needs more details, feel free to edit it and submit a pull request.

- **Issues**: Check the issue tracker and help us resolve open issues.

- **Features**: Have an idea on how to improve the project? Don't hesitate to share your thoughts, even if you don't know how to implement it.

## Pull Requests

Before creating a Pull Request (PR), please create an issue first or comment on an existing issue that you want to work on this. After that, here are some general guidelines for creating a PR:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If applicable, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints (run `flake8 .`).

Remember, code reviews are a tool for the benefit of the codebase and help everyone involved for continued learning and improvement. Be generous with your praise, and seek to constructively resolve conflicts.

Whether your contributions are coding or not, all contributions are appreciated, and they help the project improve.

Thank you again, and happy contributing!
